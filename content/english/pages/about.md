    Every technology we create is, in fact, a part of a bigger picture. 
    **We are crating the operating system of the future: The Universal OS.**
    It will be one operating system for everything from smart homes, mobile
    and wearable devices, desktops, super computers, to cars, rockets and 
    space stations. We already have a prototype of how the operating system
    works on a highly dynamic distributed environment. **We are Universal 
    Informatics and we are creating the universe of your future.**
